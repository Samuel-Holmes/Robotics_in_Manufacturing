# The Application of Robotics: Automation of Hazardous Tasks Within the Manufacturing Industry

## Introduction â€“ Overview of the Problem Solved and Rationale for Topic Choice

This report discusses how robotics has been implemented to automate hazardous tasks in manufacturing. It explores early systems like the UNIMATE 1900 and modern robotics such as ABB's IRB 2600, highlighting technological evolution in workplace safety and automation. The report also reflects on the societal, legal, and ethical implications of using robotics in industry.

## The Application of Computer Science in Solving the Problem

The development of industrial robotics began with the UNIMATE 1900, which lacked modern adaptability and required manual reprogramming. Modern systems like ABB's IRB 2600 use advanced memory systems and programming environments such as RAPID and RobotStudio, making them more user-friendly and efficient. Advances in sensors, AI integration, and safety systems such as light curtains have further enhanced operational safety and precision.

## Measuring Success and the Societal Impact of Industrial Robotics

Robotics has increased production efficiency and worker safety, evident from the productivity improvements at GM and a decrease in workplace fatalities. While robotics reduces physical risk, it may introduce mental health concerns and skill gaps. It also creates new opportunities in engineering and programming roles.

## Legal, Ethical and Professional Issues Associated with Industrial Robotics

There are legal concerns around liability and compliance with safety regulations. Ethically, issues arise in programming biases and environmental impact due to hardware waste. Professional concerns include ensuring proper training and managing workforce transitions as automation becomes more widespread.

## Conclusion and Future Considerations

The robotics industry has evolved significantly since 1969. Moving forward, responsible development and continuous refinement of technologies and regulations will be crucial. Ensuring safety, accessibility, and ethical standards are maintained will determine the long-term success and societal benefits of robotics in manufacturing.
